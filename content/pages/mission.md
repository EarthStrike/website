		<h1>Our Mission</h1>
		<p>We, the people of the world, are striking to save the planet.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="text text-rect">
		<p>The world’s leading climate scientists have warned us that we have until 2030 to prevent temperature increases from exceeding 1.5°C. That’s a little over a decade – by environmental standards, the blink of an eye.</p>
		<p>If this temperature rise reaches 2°C, the results will be catastrophic: mass extinction, famine, droughts, floods, wildfires, and the spread of infectious diseases, on an unprecedented global scale. The time to act is now, before it’s too late.</p>
		<p>According to the CDP’s 2017 Carbon Majors Report, 71% of the world’s global industrial greenhouse gas emissions come from just 100 polluters. It is clear by now that the interests of big business do not drive the prosperity of the human race. As a society, we need to change course.</p>
		<p>To this end, our protests, scheduled throughout 2019, will serve to raise awareness for a global general strike, beginning September 27.</p>
		<p>Until the world’s governments and businesses are held accountable to the people, we are refusing to participate in the system that fills their pockets. There will be no banking, no offices full of employees, no schools full of children, until our demands are met.</p>

	<div id="demands" class="text body-rect">
		<h3>International Demands</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><p>An immediate start on global co-operation to reverse the damage done to the Earth’s climate, through unambiguous and binding agreements, by both world leaders and corporate entities, following IPCC projections of halving carbon net emissions by 2030 and zero net emissions by 2050.</p></li>
			<li><p>International, unambiguous and binding commitments to halt the destruction of rainforests and other wildlife habitats.</p></li>
			<li><p>International, unambiguous and binding agreements designed to hold corporations accountable for the greenhouse gases they produce.</p></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="text text-rect">
		<p>Individual national campaigns, per our commitment to St. Paul’s principles of activism, may have additional demands. These demands are stated on their <a href="map">national pages</a>.</p>

		<p>As citizens of this planet, we implore you to work with us, in the best interests of our species, to both mitigate and prepare for the effects of climate change. Spread our message, organize with your community, and take a stand for the future. <strong>The Earth shall go on strike!</strong></p>
